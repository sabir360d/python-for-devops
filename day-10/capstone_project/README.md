# DevOps Log Analyzer API (Capstone Project)

## Overview
This project demonstrates how Python can be used to solve real-world DevOps problems.
It analyzes application logs and exposes insights through a FastAPI-based REST API.

## Problem Statement
Application logs grow continuously and manually checking them for errors is time-consuming
and inefficient for DevOps teams.

## Solution
I built a Python-based log analyzer that:
- Reads application logs
- Counts log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Allows filtering via API
- Exposes results using FastAPI

## Features
- Log analysis using Python
- REST API using FastAPI
- Health check endpoint
- Optional log level filtering
- Clean and modular code

## API Endpoints
